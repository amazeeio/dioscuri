# Deprecated

As of Lagoon v2.17.0 Dioscuri as a separate component was removed from being a requirement of the active/standby configuration in Lagoon. As of Lagoon v2.18.0 the subchart that installs Dioscuri in Lagoon is removed.
Since there will be no further updates to Dioscuri, this repository will be archived and receive no more updates.

# Dioscuri
> The Dioscuri were regarded as helpers of humankind and held to be patrons of travellers and of sailors in particular, who invoked them to seek favourable winds

Dioscuri is a Kubernetes Operator that enables routes to be migrated between namespaces. This allows projects deployed into a standby namespace to quickly change routes from an active namespace to become the active namespace.
